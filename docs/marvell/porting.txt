ATF Porting Guide
=================

This section describes how to port ATF to a customer board, assuming that the SoC being used is already supported
in ATF.

Source code structure
---------------------
- The cusomer platform specific code shall reside under "plat/marvell/<soc family>/<soc>_cust"
	(e.g. 'plat/marvell/a8k/a7040_cust').
- The platform name for build purposes is called "<soc>_cust" (e.g. a7040_cust).
- The build system will reuse all files from within the soc directory, and take only the porting
  files from the customer platform directory.


Porting
-------
Files that require porting are located at "plat/marvell/<soc family>/<soc>_cust" directory.

A7K/A8K specific:

  - SoC Physical Address Map (marvell_plat_config.c):
	- This file describes the SoC physical memory mapping to be used for the CCU, RFU, AXI-MBUS and IOB
	  address decode units (Refer to the functional spec for more details).
	- In most cases, using the default address decode windows should work OK.
	- In cases where a special physical address map is needed (e.g. Special size for PCIe MEM windows,
	  large memory mapped SPI flash...), then porting of the SoC memory map is required.
	- Note: For a detailed information on how CCU, RFU, AXI-MBUS & IOB work, please refer to the SoC functional spec,
	  and under "doc/marvell/misc/mvebu-[ccu/iob/amb/rfu].txt" files.

  - booloader recovery (marvell_plat_config.c):
	- Background:
		bootrom can skip the current image and choose to boot from next position if a specific value
		(0xDEADB002) is returned by the ble main function
		This feature is used for bootloader recovery by booting from a valid flash-image saved on the next
		position on flash.
		(e.g. address 2M in SPI flash)
		supported options to implement the skip request:
		o GPIO
		o I2C
		o User defined

	- Porting:
		under marvell_plat_config.c need to implement struct skip_image that includes the specific board
		parameters.
	- Example
		o A7040-DB specific implementation (.....marvell/plat/a8k/a70x0/board/marvell_plat_config.c)
		The image skip is implemented by using GPIO:
		mpp 33 (SW5)
		before reseting the board make sure there is a valid image on the next flash address:
			-tftp [valid address] flash-image.bin
			-sf update [valid address] 0x2000000 [size]
		press reset and keep pressing on the button connected to the chosen GPIO pin, a skip image request
		message is supposed to print on the screen and the bootrom boots from the saved image at the next position.

  - DDR Porting (dram_port.c):
	- This file defines the dram topology and parameters of the target board.
	- The DDR code is part of the BLE component, which is an extension of ARM Trusted Firmware (ATF).
	- The DDR driver called mv_ddr is released separately apart from ATF sources.
	- The BLE and consequently, the DDR init code is executed at the early stage of the boot process.
	- Each supported platform of the ATF has its own DDR porting file called dram_port.c located at
		"atf/plat/marvell/a8k/<platform>/board" directory.
	- Please refer to 'mv_ddr/doc/porting_guide.txt' for detailed porting description.
	  The build target directory is "build/<platform>/release/ble".

A3700 specific:

  - Wake up source configuration for Low Power mode (pm_src.c):
	- This file defines the wake up source for Low Power mode of the target board.
	- Each supported platform of the ATF should have its own wake up source file called pm_src.c
		located at "atf/plat/marvell/a3700/<platform>/board" directory.
	- In pm_src.c, a dedicate routine with name mv_wake_up_src_config_get() should be defined, which
		would be called by A3700 power management framework to get wake up source configuration.
			struct pm_wake_up_src_config *mv_wake_up_src_config_get(void)
	- The supported wake up source are South bridge, North bridge GPIO, Uart TX/RX, and each platform
		could have up to 4 different wake up sources at the same time.
	- Wake up source configuration is defined as "struct pm_wake_up_src_config"
		o wake_up_src_num: the number of wake up source, could be up to 4.
		o wake_up_src: the array for each wake up source configuration.
			- wake_up_src_type: now the only supported one is WAKE_UP_SRC_GPIO.
			- wake_up_data: wake up source data.
				gpio_data.bank_num: GPIO bank number, 0 for North bridge GPIO, 1 for
					South bridge GPIO.
				gpio_data.gpio_num: GPIO number that is used as wake up source.
	- Example of A3700-DB wake up source:
		static struct pm_wake_up_src_config wake_up_src_cfg = {
			.wake_up_src_num = 3,
			.wake_up_src[0] = {
				.wake_up_src_type = WAKE_UP_SRC_GPIO,
				.wake_up_data = {
					.gpio_data.bank_num = 0, /* North Bridge */
					.gpio_data.gpio_num = 14
				}
			},
			.wake_up_src[1] = {
				.wake_up_src_type = WAKE_UP_SRC_GPIO,
				.wake_up_data = {
					.gpio_data.bank_num = 1, /* South Bridge */
					.gpio_data.gpio_num = 2
				}
			},
			.wake_up_src[2] = {
				.wake_up_src_type = WAKE_UP_SRC_UART1,
				}
			}
		};
		struct pm_wake_up_src_config *mv_wake_up_src_config_get(void)
		{
			return &wake_up_src_cfg;
		}
