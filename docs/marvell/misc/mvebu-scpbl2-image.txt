Marvell support for scp_bl2 concatenated images
===============================================

The Armada 8K has 5 service CPUs and Armada 7K has 3. Therefore it was required
to provide a method for loading firmware to all of the service CPUs. To achieve
that, the scp_bl2 image in fact is file containing up to 5 concatenated
firmwares.

The Marvell ATF platform code is able to recognize new format of scp_bl2 image,
interpret it correctly, restore built-in images and load particular image to
appropriate service CPU pointed in image header.

scp_bl2 file format
-------------------
The new scp_bl2 file format is:
	0x0:	File header (magic, nr_of_images)
	0x8:	Image header 0 (type, length, version)
	0x14:	Image header 1 (type, length, version)
	...
	0xyy	Build-in image described by image header 0
	0xzz	Build-in image described by image header 1
	...

The possible images that can be built in scp_bl2 image are firmwares for:
mss ap cm3, mss cp0 cm3, mss cp1 cm3, mg cp0 cm3 and mg cp1 cm3. Thanks to the
file format and headers for each file, ATF platform code is able to recognise
how many files are built-in and what is their destination (to which co-processor
they need to be loaded).

Tool for concatenating multiple images
--------------------------------------
The doimage_scp_bl2 tool allows to concatenate multiple CM3 images into one
output file (scp_bl2 image). The possible images that can be concatenated are
dedicated for: mss ap cm3, mss cp0 cm3, mss cp1 cm3, mg cp0 cm3 and mg cp1 cm3
and they can be specified via appropriate options of mentioned tool.

The tool for concatenating img is part of Marvell firmware repository and is
used automatically or manually to create common concatenated scp_bl2 image. More
information about usage can be find in doimage_scp_bl2 help.
